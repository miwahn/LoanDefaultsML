This Notebook was created as part of project for the MIT Professional Education Data Science Program.

The purpose was to:
* build and tune Machine Learning models for Loan Default Prediction (classification problem)
* select the best model based on the business case
* provide some actionable recommendations
* highlight the limitations of the model

Disclaimer: this is by no means not Production-level code but a simple prototype for the case study. It was built in a week so likely to include a few errors or useless functions here and there - feel free to send your comments.
